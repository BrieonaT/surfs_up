# Overview
This analysis is looking into weather conditions for the island of Oahu in Hawaii. This is done to show an investor if the conditions are ideal to open up a surf shack ice cream parlor. The investor had a previous surf shack venture rained out of business, hence why it’s important to look into if the conditions will be favorable to open up the store. This showcases data from June and December of previous years.


# Results
Three major conclusions you can draw from the analysis are as follows:
- The high temperatures of June are around 85 degrees fahrenheit, whereas the lows are around 64 degrees.
- The high temperatures of December are around 83 degrees fahrenheit, whereas the lows are 56 degrees.
- The temperature average for June is 74 degrees and December’s temperature average is 71 degrees.

# Summary
In conclusion, the data shows that the temperatures stay fairly consistent between June and December. Both months have little differences in their average temperature, and stay warm even in the winter time. However, temperature isn’t the only factor that would be beneficial for this analysis. In further analysis, it’d be opportune to also look into average rainfall for these months, especially in the case of large storms. It would also be beneficial to collect data for other weather factors such as cloudiness.
